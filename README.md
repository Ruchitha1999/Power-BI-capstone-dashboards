# Power-BI-capstone-dashboards

-	Shop Nest, a leading e-commerce marketplace in Portugal, provided retail data and required a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for business analytics. And stakeholders needed insights into sales performance, customer behaviour, and delivery efficiency.
- Performed data cleaning, created data model relationships, and added DAX measures for total sales, revenue, delays, ratings, and seasonal trends.
- Built visuals such as bar charts, pie charts, drill-through pages, matrix tables, and line charts. Implemented calculated columns to identify delayed vs on-time deliveries by comparing actual vs estimated delivery dates.
- Designed interactive filter panels (category, state, year, payment method).
- Built an end-to-end Power BI dashboard, including top categories by sales, delayed order analysis, payment method analysis, state-wise sales, seasonal trends, and revenue analysis.
- Delivered a fully interactive Power BI dashboard. Helped stakeholders identify top-selling categories, delayed order hot spots, preferred payment methods, and seasonal revenue peaks.
- Improved decision-making efficiency and reduced manual analysis effort by over 70%.
